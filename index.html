                    <h2 class="title">Offense</h2>
                    <p>Going into 2019 the biggest question mark for the Tennessee Titans was the offense.
                        So far this season the only thing they've done consistently is be inconsistent. In week 1 
                        they managed to score more than 30 points, something that did not happen at all in 2018, only
                        to drop off significantly in weeks 2 and 3. Quarterback <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Mariota">Marcus Mariota</a>
                        , who is playing for a new contract next year, is off to a solid start. He has thrown for 7 touchdowns and 0
                        interceptions. However he has been sacked
                        17 times already this year which has hindered the offense in 2 of their 5 games this year. If the Titans hope to
                        continue to improve their offense this year they'll have to protect the QB better than they have this year. On paper the Titans offense has plenty
                        of talent but they haven't been able to take advantage of their good players. First year offense coordinator Arthur Smith showed a good gameplan in week 1
                        but from that point on the offense has not been able to get back to scoring a lot of points.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        One bright spot for the Titans this year has been 4th year running back Derrick Henry. Henry finished off last year with over 1000 yards rushing and 12 rushing touchdowns
                        and so far this year he is on pace to improve on those achievements. He's averaging about 78 yards per game rushing (vs 66 per game last year) and has 4 rushing touchdowns
                        in 5 games. In addition to this he has another 97 yards receiving and one receiving touchdown. On a team where several players are up and down from week to week, Henry's consistency
                        will be key for them if they hope to improve going forward.

                    <h2 class="title">Defense</h2>
                    <p>
                        While the Titans offense has been inconsistent, the defense has been consistently great over the course
                        of the season. They started off the season with a dominant performance against the Browns in week 1, holding the Browns
                        to 13 points in a game where they managed to get 5 sacks and 3 interceptions (one of which they returned for a touchdown)
                        Overall they are 5th in the league in points allowed through 4 games. While the defense has several good players, perhaps 
                        their biggest asset is interior defensive lineman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurrell_Casey">Jurrell Casey</a>. 
                        The four time all star is one of the best players at his position across the NFL and has continued to play well in his 9th 
                        season as a pro. In their week 4 matchup against the Atlanta Falcons, Casey sacked Falcons' QB Matt Ryan and caused him to 
                        fumble the ball and gave his team possession. If the Titans defense can stay on track and avoid injuries they should continue 
                        to be one of the top units in the league. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        The Titans secondary is among the best in the league and they have the confidence to go with it. They proudly go by the nickname MMCNB (My Man Catch No Balls), a nickname
                        they live up to for the most part. They're led by safety Kevin Byard, who earned an All-Pro designation in his second year in the NFL and became the highest paid safety in
                        the NFL before the start of this season. Byard and Logan Ryan each have two interceptions on the year so far, while Malcolm Butler has one interception that he returned for a 
                        touchdown in week 1 against the Browns. Hard-hitting safety Kenny Vaccaro has also been a key piece of the defense so far, contributing both as a force in stopping the run and 
                        covering receivers on passing plays.

                    <h2 class="title">Special Teams</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Titans had a major scare to their special teams unit right before the season started when their longtime kicker 
                        Ryan Succop announced he was going on Injured Reserve. This came after he had off-season surgery on his kicking leg 
                        and has not yet regained full strength. The team had to sign free agent kicker Cairo Santos, who also replaced Succop
                        in Kansas City previously. Santos started the season as a capable backup making 4 out of 5 field goals (including 1 from 53 yars out)
                        and has been perfect in extra points. However in week 5 against the Buffalo Bills Santos missed all 4 of his field goal attempts,
                        including one from 35 yards out. After a performance like that it wouldn't surpise many if the Titans are back in the market for a kicker, 
                        but what is certain is that they will be eager to get their usual kicker back. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        The real star of the special teams unit however has been punter Brett Kern. Kern 
                        is 5th in the league in percentage of punts that are downed within the 20 yard line, which shows he consistenly puts opponents
                        deep in their own side of the field. He also has a punt of 70 yards this season, good for 4th longest this season. It isn't usually the case
                        that a team's best player is the punter, however in the case of Brett Kern that could very well be the case. Returning kicks and punts has been
                        an underwhelming aspect of the Titans' game this year, and at times it has been downright bad. At this point the team's only expection of the kick/punt
                        returners is that they don't lose the football, which they've already failed to do twice this year.
