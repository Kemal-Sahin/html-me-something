                    <h2>Offense</h2>
                    <p>Going into 2019 the biggest question mark for the Tennessee Titans was the offense.
                        So far this season the only thing they've done consistently is be inconsistent. In week 1 
                        they managed to score more than 30 points, something that did not happen at all in 2018, only
                        to drop off significantly in weeks 2 and 3. Quarterback <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Mariota">Marcus Mariota</a>
                        , who is playing for a new contract next year, is off to a solid start. He has thrown for 7 touchdowns, 0
                        interceptions, 933 passing yards and a 106.2 QB Rating- good for 7th in the league. However he has been sacked
                        17 times already this year which has hindered the offense in 2 of their 4 games this year. If the Titans hope to
                        continue to improve their offense this year they'll have to protect the QB better than they have this year.

                    <h2>Defense</h2>
                    <p>
                        While the Titans offense has been inconsistent, the defense has been consistently great over the course
                        of the season. They started off the season with a dominant performance against the Browns in week 1, holding the Browns
                        to 13 points in a game where they managed to get 5 sacks and 3 interceptions (one of which they returned for a touchdown)
                        Overall they are 5th in the league in points allowed through 4 games. While the defense has several good players, perhaps 
                        their biggest asset is interior defensive lineman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurrell_Casey">Jurrell Casey</a>. 
                        The four time all star is one of the best players at his position across the NFL and has continued to play well in his 9th 
                        season as a pro. In their week 4 matchup against the Atlanta Falcons, Casey sacked Falcons' QB Matt Ryan and caused him to 
                        fumble the ball and gave his team possession. If the Titans defense can stay on track and avoid injuries they should continue 
                        to be one of the top units in the league.

                    <h2>Special Teams</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Titans had a major scare to their special teams unit right before the season started when their longtime kicker 
                        Ryan Succop announced he was going on Injured Reserve. This came after he had off-season surgery on his kicking leg 
                        and has not yet regained full strength. The team had to sign free agent kicker Cairo Santos, who also replaced Succop
                        in Kansas City previously. Santos has been a capable backup making 4 out of 5 field goals (including 1 from 53 yars out)
                        and has been perfect in extra points. The real star of the special teams unit however has been punter Brett Kern. Kern 
                        is 5th in the league in percentage of punts that are downed within the 20 yard line, which shows he consistenly puts opponents
                        deep in their own side of the field. He also has a punt of 70 yards this season, good for 4th longest this season.
